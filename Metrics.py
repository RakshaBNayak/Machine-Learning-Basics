""" Metrics calculations are done as follows:
    
True positives .TP/: These refer to the positive tuples that were correctly labeled by
the classifier. Let TP be the number of true positives.

True negatives .TN/: These are the negative tuples that were correctly labeled by the
classifier. Let TN be the number of true negatives.

False positives .FP/: These are the negative tuples that were incorrectly labeled as
positive (e.g., tuples of class buys computer D no for which the classifier predicted
buys computer D yes). Let FP be the number of false positives.

False negatives .FN/: These are the positive tuples that were mislabeled as negative
(e.g., tuples of class buys computer D yes for which the classifier predicted
buys computer D no). Let FN be the number of false negatives
